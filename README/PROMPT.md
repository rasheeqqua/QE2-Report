You will have to create necessary configuration files for a LaTex project. The project is about writing a technical report that criticises the Journal Paper titled `Zero-suppressed Ternary Decision Diagram Algorithm for Solving Non-coherent Fault Trees in Probabilistic Risk Assessment of Nuclear Power Plants`. So, this work brutally criticise the above mentioned journal paper but make it technical, logical and coherent at the same time. Now this is what the content table will look like:
```Table of Contents
- Abstract
- Introduction:
  - Introduction to PRA
  - Introduction to Fault Tree Quantification
  - Introduction to Event Tree Quantification
  - Event Trees with Linked Fault Trees
- Introduction to BDD
- Introduction to ZBDD
- Introduction to TDD
- Introduction to ZTDD
- Critical review of the ZTDD method introduced in the journal paper
- ZTDD vs Traditional FT Quantification Methods (MOCUS, MICSUP, Kinetic Tree Theory with approximation like REA, MCUB, Min-Max)
- ZTDD vs Decision Diagrams
- ZTDD vs Normal Forms (d-DNNF, s-DNNF, sd-DNNF, SDD)
- ZTDD vs Monte Carlo
- Application of all these methods in PRA of large event trees with linked fault trees for Advanced Nuclear Reactors (but mainly we will talk about the time and space complexity of all these methods to show that there is no one single method that fits all the use cases, but depending on the type of calculation being done we can choose a suitable algorithm.
